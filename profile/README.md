Looking to “honor the timeless stories that remind us of the importance of family, no matter what form it takes,” the Family Film and TV Awards dish out prizes to the entertainment that has brought us together not only in the past year, but throughout history, with categories ranging from the latest blockbusters to the all-time classics.

The big names up for awards this year include Ryan Renyolds, Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya for Outstanding Actors in a Feature Film while Iain Armitage may finally receive his flowers for his wonderfully sensitive portrayal of “Young Sheldon” in the Outstanding Actors in a TV Series category. Prizes will also be dished out to films new and old with the likes of Christmastime classics “Elf” and “Mary Poppins” up for Best Iconic Film and 2024 mega-hits “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” and “Dune: Part 2” hoping to walk away with the Best Feature Film award.

There’s also a celebration of family TV, from non-scripted shows in categories such as Best Competition Series Television and Outstanding Reality Show to Best Iconic Classic Television Series, with all time greats such as “Saved by the Bell,” “Happy Days” and “Home Improvement” on the ballot. There’s also a special Icon Award, which will honor Jerry Mathers, beloved for his role as Beaver Cleaver in “Leave it to Beaver.”

Ready for a spectacular hour of family friendly glitz and glamour? Here's where to watch the 27th Annual Family Film and TV Awards online from anywhere.
